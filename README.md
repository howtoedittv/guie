üåü Guie - A Simple Wrapper for BSD's `ee` File Editor

cd guie

‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration
After downloading and extracting Guie, follow these steps to complete the setup.

Step 1: Run the configuration scripts
First, configure Alacritty by running:

./alacrittyconfig

Next, run the installer script:

./installscript

Step 2: Apply shell configuration
Choose the shell you‚Äôre using (bash or zsh) and run the appropriate script.

For bash:

./bashconfig

For zsh:

./zshconfig

Step 3: Finalize folder setup
Create the necessary directories for Guie by running:

For single-file editing, simply use ee with the desired filename:
